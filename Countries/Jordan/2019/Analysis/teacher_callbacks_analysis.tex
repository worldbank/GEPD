\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

In Jordan, a number of teachers that we selected to interview were
absent, and as a result, we could not collect their information in the
school. In these cases, replacement teachers were selected and these
replacement teachers were interviewed. If a teacher was absent, we asked
the enumerators to record their phone numbers, so that we could contact
them with a follow up. The survey firm then contacted randomly 35
teachers and asked them a set of questions.

In what follows, we will explore whether teachers that were absent
systematically differ from teachers that were present to answer the
survey by comparing their answers to the same set of questions.
