abstract: "To help countries put an end to Learning Poverty, the World Bank's Education Global Practice has developed and is supporting countries in the deployment of the Global Education Policy Dashboard (GEPD). This new tool offers a strong basis for identifying priorities for investment and policy reforms that are suited to each country context. It does so by (1) highlighting gaps between what the evidence suggests is effective in promoting learning and what is happening in practice in each system; and (2) allowing governments to track progress as they take action to close those gaps.  In this article, the conceptual foundations of the GEPD will be presented along with the methodology behind data collection. Additionally, findings from five countries will be discussed: Peru, Jordan, Rwanda, Ethiopia, and Madagascar."

# Introduction

[The next three paragraphs are pulled verbatim from technical note.  This is just a placeholder, as we should add custom motivation]

Many countries, despite having significantly increased access to education for their children and youth, now realize that they are facing a learning crisis. In low- and middle-income countries, where enrollment in primary school is nearly universal, even before the COVID-19 pandemic hit, 53% of children suffered from Learning Poverty—meaning that they could not read and understand a short age-appropriate story by age 10. This reality underlines that schooling is not the same as learning, even though education policy often assumes that it is. The learning crisis has only deepened with the extended school closures and the sharp recessions caused by the pandemic.

The World Development Report 2018 argued that the learning crisis has multiple causes: poor service delivery in schools and communities, policies that are not aligned toward learning for all, and unhealthy politics and low bureaucratic capacity. To tackle the crisis and improve student learning for all, countries need to know where they stand on these three key dimensions—practices (or service delivery), policies, and politics. But providing such a systemwide overview requires better measurement. Many drivers of learning are not captured by existing administrative systems. And although new measurement tools capture some of these drivers well, no single instrument pulls together data on all these areas. This gap leaves policymakers in the dark about what is working and what isn’t.

To fill this gap, the World Bank, with support from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the UK’s Department for International Development, and the Government of Japan, has launched a Global Education Policy Dashboard, which measures the key drivers of learning outcomes in basic education around the world. In doing so, the GEPD highlights where systems are falling short in providing quality education for all children,  identifies gaps between current practice and what evidence suggests would be most effective in promoting learning for all, and helps governments in setting priorities and tracking progress as they work to close those gaps.

# Methodology

The Dashboard project collects new data in each country using three new instruments: A School Survey, a Policy Survey, and a Survey of Public Officials. Data collection involves school visits, classroom observations, legislative reviews, teacher and student assessments, and interviews with teachers, principals, and public officials. In addition, the project draws on some existing data sources to complement the new data it collects. A major objective of the GEPD project was to develop focused, cost-effective instruments and data-collection procedures, so that the dashboard can be inexpensive enough to be implemented (and re-implemented) in many countries. The team achieved this by streamlining and simplifying existing instruments, and thereby reducing the time required for data collection and training of enumerators.

![](plots/cost_fig.png)

## Instruments 

A detailed description of the GEPD instruments is available in the [GEPD Technical Note](https://www.educationpolicydashboard.org/sites/epd/files/resources-documents/GEPD%20Technical%20Note.pdf).  Additionally, all code used to construct the indicators is available in the Global Education Policy Dashboard [Github page](https://github.com/worldbank/GEPD).  A shorter description pertaining to each of the three instruments can be found below:

•	School Survey: The School Survey collects data primarily on Practices (the quality of service delivery in schools), but also on some de facto Policy indicators.  It consists of streamlined versions of existing instruments used by the World Bank and partners—including Service Delivery Indicators (SDI) Surveys on teachers and inputs/infrastructure, TEACH on pedagogical practice, Global Early Child Development Database (GECDD) and Measuring Early Learning Quality and Outcomes (MELQO) on school readiness of young children, and the Development World Management Survey (D-WMS) on management quality—together with new questions to fill gaps in those instruments. Though the number of modules in the School Survey is similar to the full version of the Service Delivery Indicators (SDI) Survey, the number of items and the complexity of the questions within each module have been reduced to streamline the survey, while additional items and assessments have been added from other instruments. The School Survey includes 8 short modules: School Information, Teacher Presence, Teacher Survey, Classroom Observation, Teacher Assessment, 1st-Grade Direct Assessment, School Management Survey, and 4th-Grade Student Assessment. 

•	Policy Survey: The Policy Survey collects information to feed into the Policy de jure indicators. This survey is filled out by key informants in each country, drawing on their knowledge to identify key elements of the policy framework (as in the SABER approach to policy-data collection that the Bank has used over the past 9 years).  The survey includes questions on policies related to teachers, school management, inputs and infrastructure, and learners. 

•	Survey of Public Officials: The Survey of Public Officials collects information about the capacity and orientation of the bureaucracy, as well as political factors affecting education outcomes. This survey is a streamlined and education-focused version of the civil-servant surveys that the Bureaucracy Lab (a joint initiative of the Governance Global Practice and the Development Impact Evaluation unit of the World Bank) has implemented recently in several countries. The survey includes questions about technical and leadership skills, work environment, stakeholder engagement, impartial decision-making, and attitudes and behaviors. 

## Sampling

The aim of the GEPD surveys is to produce nationally representative estimates with enough precision to allow detection of changes over time at a minimum power of 80% and at a 0.05 significance level. The GEPD also sets aims to detect differences by urban/rural location and by gender on relevant indicators.  In some cases, we can provide statistics by region, but this will depend on the geography of the country and the number of regions making up that country.  

For the GEPD School Survey, a two-stage random sample design is used.  In the first stage, Bank staff select a random sample of around 200 schools.  The sample is stratified based on urban/rural classification and the region in which schools are located. When stratifying by region, the GEPD team works with partners within the country to make sure all relevant geographical divisions are included. In the second stage, a random sample of teachers and students is selected to answer questions from the survey modules; this sampling is done by enumerators in the field at each school. Ten teachers per school are sampled for attendance checks, and five teachers are interviewed and given a teacher assessment. Three randomly selected 1st grade students are assessed, as is a randomly selected classroom of 4th grade students.  We could only interview three 1st grade students, compared to an entire 4th grade classroom, because the 1st grade assessment is done face to face by our enumerators and takes a considerable amount of time per student (~15-20 minutes).  The 4th grade assessment can be given to an entire class simultaneously.

For the GEPD Survey of Public Officials, 200 public education officials in each country are randomly selected for interviews.  These public officials are typically professional staff at the Ministry of Education central office, as well as from the regional or district offices. Roughly 60 officials are surveyed at the federal (or central-government) level, while 140 officials are surveyed at the regional/district level.  To select officials at the regional and district level, the team employs a cluster sampling strategy, where 10 regional offices are chosen at random from among the regions in which schools were sampled. Among these 10 regions, 10 districts are selected (one in each region) from among the districts in which schools are sampled. The result of this sampling approach is that for 10 clusters, the GEPD captures the links from the school to the district office, to the regional office, and then to the central office. In each regional/district office, 7 officials are sampled: the head of the office, the HR director, and 5 officials working in finance and planning chosen at random.  At the federal level, the GEPD team works with the Ministry of Education to identify the offices that should be included in the sample according to the functions they serve. In each office, the director of the office is interviewed along with a randomly selected number of public officials. The team aims to maintain roughly the same sampling strategy for the Survey of Public Officials for all countries, with some adaptation to country characteristics. For instance, in countries with smaller district offices, a larger number of district offices will be sampled, with fewer public officials interviewed at each of them. In countries with smaller offices at the federal level, fewer public officials will be interviewed at the federal level and more will be interviewed at the decentralized level. Ultimately, these adaptations are the result of extensive dialogue with the country counterparts. 


Before producing the sample using the stratification approach, the sampling frame is defined. Typically, the sampling frame includes all schools with at least three 1st-grade and at least three 4th-grade students, according to the latest school census. This minimum size was set to ensure that enough teachers and students would be interviewed on the limited budget available for each country.  To develop this sampling frame, the GEPD team works with the World Bank country teams and the country counterparts to compile an up-to-date and detailed database containing information on schools. Depending on the country, the sampling frame may include private schools, typically because a large share of students attends private schools. This sampling decision is jointly made by World Bank and country counterparts. As an example, in Peru only public schools were sampled, because private schools represent a small share of the schools in the country. Alternatively, in Jordan, the percentage of private schools was larger, and so a decision was made to include both public and private schools. 

For the stratified sampling, the stratification variables used are the rural/urban status of each school as well as the 1st- or 2nd-level administrative division (while the denomination changes, in most cases, the 1st administrative division is the province/department-level and the 2nd division corresponds to districts). For example, in Peru, the department and urban/rural status of the school made up the stratification variables. In cases where private schools are also included in the sampling frame, as in Jordan, the public/private status of the school is also included as a stratification variable.

In each country, the sampling strategy is slightly customized to reflect ongoing efforts and meet country needs. This is discussed further in the Data section below.

# Data

Table 1: GEPD Data Collection Overview


| Country | Dates | Number of Schools | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| Peru | November 2019 | 205 |     MELQO data was merged with the Peru school sampling frame to allow optimal stratification. The stratification was done on the basis of urban/rural   location and department. There are 25 departments in Peru. In 2017, Peru   conducted an examination of around 4,500 children aged 5-8, with a median age   of 6. The MELQO assessment is quite similar to the GEPD 1st-Grade Direct   Assessment. Using data from this 2017 survey, the team calculated means and   standard deviations by province and fed this information into the optimal   stratification algorithm. Provinces with low standard deviations among   students in terms of their MELQO development scores are allocated fewer   schools compared to an allocation that is simply based on population, and   provinces with high standard deviations are allocated more schools. 205   schools were chosen for the GEPD School Survey after optimally stratifying.    |
| Jordan | December 2019 | 250 |     For the GEPD School Survey, both public and private schools that are supervised   by the Ministry or Education were included in the sampling frame. Schools   supervised by Ministry of Defense, Ministry of Endowments, Ministry of Higher   Education, or Ministry of Social Development were excluded from the sampling   frame. This left a sampling frame containing 3,330 schools, with 1297 private   schools and 2003 public schools. Schools kept needed to have at least three 1st-grade   students, three 4th-grade students, and three teachers. Southern   schools were oversampled (to reach a total of 50 Southern schools) to allow regional   comparisons. Additionally, second-shift (evening) schools were oversampled,   for a total of 40 second-shift schools, to allow reporting on this unique   type of school.   Second-shift schools   make up around 16% of our total sample, while they make up 7.6% of the   schools in our sampling frame.  When   producing a national estimate, we reweight the schools to be reflective of   their totals in the population. 250 schools were sampled for the School   Survey after the discussed adaptations.     |
| Rwanda | February 2020 | 200 |     In the case of Rwanda, the GEPD team tested the possibility of each field team   visiting 2 schools per day. To allow visits to two schools per day, the team clustered   at the sector level and chose two schools per cluster. With a sample of 200   schools, this means that 100 PSUs had to be allocated. This clustering was   combined with stratification by district and by the urban/rural status of the   schools. The number of PSUs allocated to each stratum is proportionate to the   number of schools in each stratum (i.e., the district X urban/rural status   combination).    |
| Ethiopia | March 2020, June 2021 | 300 | In Ethiopia, a sample of 300 public schools from each of the provinces of Ethiopia was taken.  As a comparison to the total number of schools in Ethiopia, this constitutes an approximately 1% sample.  Because of the large size of the country, and because there can be very large distances between Woredas within the same province, a cluster sampling approach was chosen.  In this approach, 100 woredas were chosen with probability proportional to 4th grade size, with the number of woredas chosen within each province proportional to the regional 4th grade population.  Then within each woreda two rural and one urban school were chosen with probability proportional to 4th grade size.  Data collection started in March 2020, but because of school closures related to COVID, only 128 schools were visited at this time.  In June 2021, data collection was resumed for the other 182 schools.  During the June 2021 data collection, security issues in Tigray meant that 6 schools out of 15 originally chosen in the original sample could not be visited.  These 6 schools were replaced by schools in Amhara province. |
| Madagascar | June 2021 | 200 | In Madagascar, the sample for the GEPD school survey was drawn to be representative of primary schools at the national and regional levels, using EMIS data of 2019. The sampling frame consisted of 33,120 public and private primary schools – 25,869 public and 7,251 private schools - across the 1,567 communes covered by EMIS data in Madagascar’s 22 regions. 200 schools were selected for the GEPD survey, where the strata are regions and urban/rural status of schools. |

)

country_tab_fn(practice_indicators, 'GEPD Practice Indicators')

```

In the GEPD 4th grade assessment, students in a randomly chosen class were given an assessment containing math and language items. More details on this examination is in the GEPD Technical Note.  A students score is the sum of the literacy sub-score and the math sub-score.  Proficiency is then based on whether the student correctly answered a set number of questions (20/24 items correct in literacy, 14/17 in math), which was determined by consulting a set of experts on whether a minimally proficient 4th grader should be able to answer the questions correctly.  

The table above highlights the low levels of learning seen in children in 4th grade in even middle income countries, such as Peru and Jordan.  In Peru, only around 33% of students reached the proficiency threshold on the 4th grade assessment.  In Jordan, the number is even lower, although schools in Jordan had recently switched to using Arabic numerals, and the children performed particularly badly in the math portion of the GEPD assessment. The low income countries (Rwanda, Ethiopia, and Madagascar) fare even worse with less than 5% of students being considered proficient.

In figure XX, the distribution of raw scores are shown for each country.  The raw scores are scaled to be between 0 and 100, where a student receiving 0 points got none of the questions correct, and a student scoring 100 got all of the questions correct. Overall scores combine literacy and math are shown.  Each point on the plot represents one student's set of responses.  Within each country there is a large dispersion of scores with at least some students scoring nearly 0 points out of 100 and at least some students scoring proficient.

Figure XX below breaks down the 4th Grade Learning Assessment scores further highlighting four items that were on the assessment: whether the student can identify 3 words from a list (e.g. respect, green, bananas), whether the student can answer a question about a short paragraph of text, whether the student can answer correctly 8+7, and whether the student can correctly answer 7x8.  In Madagascar, the percentage of children able to identify three short words was only 63.2%.  The percentage able to solve 7x8 in Madagascar was only 26.7%, while in Peru, the best performing country, the rate was only around 73%.

Student Readiness, as measured by the GEPD 1st grade assessment, is another area where countries could improve. 

The first grade assessment tool was derived mostly from the MELQO assessment and covers the domains of numeracy, literacy, socio-emotional skills and executive functioning.

The sub-domains for the literacy section are:

*	Expressive Vocabulary
* Letter Identification
*	Word Recognition
*	Sentence Reading
*	Listening Comprehension Story 
*	Name Writing
*	Print Awareness


The sub-domains for the math section are:

*	Verbal Counting
*	Producing a Set
*	Number Identification
*	Number Comparison
*	Simple Addition


The sub-domains for the socio-emotional section are:

*	Perspective Taking/Empathy
*	Conflict Resolution

The sub-domains for the executive functioning section are:

*	Working Memory/Backward Digit Spans
*	Follow Instructions/Head, Toes, Knees, Shoulders Task

The threshold for proficiency on our 1st grade assessment is to score at least 80% of the items correctly. This approach was validated by calculating the percent correct in the top 25% highest scoring schools in Peru on our 4th grade dashboard assessment and found that students in these schools answered around this percentage of items correct.

In Peru, only a little over 60% of students met this proficiency level, and in Madagascar, the number was only around 5%.  In most countries there are large differences between students in urban and rural schools (shown in Figure XX below).  For instance in Peru, the average raw score on the 1st grade assessment was around 80% for urban schools, while it was around 64% for rural schools.  In Madagascar that gap was 59% to 47%.  Only in Jordan was there little observable difference in student readiness between children in urban and rural schools.

When looking at the scores on the underlying domains in figure XX below, children were typically scoring highest on the numeracy section.  Children in Peru, Jordan, and Ethiopia answered close to 90% of the math items correctly.  On the literacy component, the average for all countries was below the 80% threshold set for proficiency.  The averages for the executive functioning and socio-emotional components were also below the 80% threshold.

Teacher pedagogical skill and content knowledge are two other areas where countries consistently struggle.  Teacher pedagogical skill is measured through the Teach assessment (ADD CITATION FOR TEACH Paper), and teacher content knowledge is measured through a teacher content examination, where teachers are asked to grade a hypothetical students work in language in mathematics.  

To be rated as proficient on the teacher pedagogical assessment, teachers must score at least 3 out 5 possible points on the Teach scale.  Few teachers managed to meet this threshold.  No country had more than 40% of teachers score proficient on the assessment.  In Ethiopia, only 19% of teachers managed to do so.  

To be rated proficient on the teacher content knowledge exam, teachers needed to get at least 80% of the items correct on the examination.  Again, relatively few teachers managed to do this.  In Peru, the highest scoring country, less than 40% of teachers managed to do so.  In Ethiopia, only 6% of teachers managed to do so.

Figure XX below shows that the teachers scoring well (or poorly) on the teacher pedagogical examination are not always the same as the teachers scoring well (or poorly) on the teacher content knowledge exam.  In the figure, each point on the scatterplot represents a single teachers content knowledge and pedagogy score.  The teacher's country is color coded in the figure.  There is only a weak relationship between the two measures, with an R squrared of only 0.08, meaning that policies targeted at teachers struggling in terms of content knowledge may have to target different teachers than a policy targeting teachers struggling in pedagogy.

## Share of learning variation explained by the Dashboard’s Practice indicators

## Relationship between School Practices and 4th Grade Learning Outcomes

Next the relationships between 4th grade learning outcomes and practices in the school are shown. The practices considered are teacher presence, teacher content knowledge, teacher pedagogical skills, availability of basic inputs, basic infrastructure, student readiness (1st grade assessment scores), operational management scores, instructional leadership, principal school knowledge, and principal management skills.  Relationships are estimated using OLS regression.  The urban/rural status of the school and the log GDP within 1km of the school are included in the regressions.^[
Data downloaded from:
https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/dataset/gross-domestic-product-2010 also see
https://preview.grid.unep.ch/index.php?preview=data&events=socec&evcat=1&lang=eng
 In the distributed global GDP dataset sub-national GRP and national GDP data are allocated to 
 30 arc second (approximately 1km) grid cells in proportion to the population residing in that cell. 
 The method also distinguishes between rural and urban population, assuming the latter to have a higher 
 GDP per capita. Input data are from 1) a global time-series dataset of GDP, with subnational gross regional 
 product (GRP) for 74 countries, compiled by the World Bank Development Economics Research Group (DECRG). 2) 
 Gridded population projections for the year 2009, based on a population grid for the year 2005 provided by 
 LandScanTM Global Population Database (Oak Ridge, TN: Oak Ridge National Laboratory). This dataset has been 
 extrapolated to year 2010 by UNEP/GRID-Geneva. Unit is estimated value of production per cell, in thousand of 
 constant 2000 USD. Cell level anomalies may occur due to poor alignment of multiple input data sources, and it 
 is strongly recommended that users attempt to verify information, or consult original sources, in order to determine 
 suitability for a particular application. This product was compiled by DECRG for the Global Assessment Report on Risk 
 Reduction (GAR). It was modeled using global data. Credit: GIS processing World Bank DECRG, Washington, DC, 
 extrapolation UNEP/GRID-Geneva.].  Additionally, a dummy variable for each country is included in the regression to adjust for between country differences in variables.

Next the relationships between an overall index of the functioning of the bureaucracy in the school district and school level outcomes are shown.  The index is formed by taking the unweighted average of the quality of bureaucracy score, the mandates and accountability score, the national learning goals score, and the impartial decision making score.  Relationships are estimated using OLS regression.  The urban/rural status of the school and the log GDP within 1km of the school are included in the regressions.^[

 In the distributed global GDP dataset sub-national GRP and national GDP data are allocated to 
 30 arc second (approximately 1km) grid cells in proportion to the population residing in that cell. 
 The method also distinguishes between rural and urban population, assuming the latter to have a higher 
 GDP per capita. Input data are from 1) a global time-series dataset of GDP, with subnational gross regional 
 product (GRP) for 74 countries, compiled by the World Bank Development Economics Research Group (DECRG). 2) 
 Gridded population projections for the year 2009, based on a population grid for the year 2005 provided by 
 LandScanTM Global Population Database (Oak Ridge, TN: Oak Ridge National Laboratory). This dataset has been 
 extrapolated to year 2010 by UNEP/GRID-Geneva. Unit is estimated value of production per cell, in thousand of 
 constant 2000 USD. Cell level anomalies may occur due to poor alignment of multiple input data sources, and it 
 is strongly recommended that users attempt to verify information, or consult original sources, in order to determine 
 suitability for a particular application. This product was compiled by DECRG for the Global Assessment Report on Risk 
 Reduction (GAR). It was modeled using global data. Credit: GIS processing World Bank DECRG, Washington, DC,

[Discussion of the linkages between indicators.  E.g. How the teacher pedagogy relates to student outcomes.  Interesting findings on De-Facto versus De-Jure.  Findings on implementation differences across geographies within a country.  Findings on Bureaucracy and school outcomes.  Can maybe highlight link with poor bureaucracy with poor inputs/infrastructure.]
