\textbf{The Global Education Policy Dashboard (GEPD): An innovative tool
to measure drivers of learning outcomes in basic education}\\
GEPD uses 3 data collection instruments to report on nearly 40
indicators that operationalize the World Development Report 2018
framework to track 3 areas for progress in education- Practices,
Policies, and Politics. Using these indicators, the dashboard highlights
areas where countries need to act to improve learning outcomes and
allows a way for governments to track progress as they act to close gaps
in these areas. For more information on GEPD, please visit
\textbf{\href{https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/education/brief/global-education-policy-dashboard}{www.worldbank.org/global-education-policy-dashboard}}

The \textbf{School Survey} consists of 8 modules to collect data across
200-300 schools on practices (the quality of service delivery in
schools) and de facto policy indicators. It consists of streamlined
versions of existing instruments together with new questions to fill
gaps in those instruments.\\
The \textbf{Policy Survey} collects information via interviews with
\textasciitilde200 officials per country at federal and regional level
to feed into the policy de jure indicators and identify key elements of
the policy framework.\\
The \textbf{Survey of public officials} collects information about the
capacity and orientation of the bureaucracy and political factors
affecting education outcomes. This survey is an education-focused
version of the civil-servant surveys from the Bureaucracy Lab, WBG.

\begin{itemize}

\item
  Substantially low learning outcomes observed for students in Grade 1
  and 4.
\item
  Weak teacher pedagogical skills and low teacher content knowledge
  attributed to poor teaching support and weak monitoring and
  accountability systems.
\item
  Grade 1 proficiency of students is \textasciitilde9\%, with students
  scoring lower on executive functions and socio-emotional learning.
  Only 13\% students are enrolled in early childhood programs which face
  gaps in caregiver skills and financial constraints.
\item
  Basic inputs and infrastructure are weak in areas of functional
  toilets and electricity in schools.
\item
  Major gaps are seen in implementation of teaching support policies,
  teaching monitoring and accountability systems and selection and
  deployment policies for school principals.
\item
  Primary education funding amount and efficiency of spending is low and
  education policy implementation is politicized, lowering bureaucratic
  capacity.

Learning adjusted years of school (LAYS) is calculated by adjusting

Practice indicators measure quality of service delivery in schools such
as teacher and student attendance, teacher knowledge, principal
management skills, etc. Policy lever indicators measure how well school,
personnel and student policies governing these practices are
implemented. For instance, teacher content knowledge(practice) is
influenced by implementation of teacher hiring policies, teacher
training and monitoring and accountability systems. Comparing de-facto
practice and policy lever indicators allows identification of
low-scoring policy levers that affect observed practice indicators.

Teacher effectiveness is determined by a teacher's own knowledge level,
pedagogical skills and effort. These practices are impacted by quality
of teaching support, teacher recruitment and deployment, level of
teaching attraction (incentives/job satisfaction), teacher motivation
and monitoring systems. Teacher content knowledge (27\%) needs

De-facto policy levers measure how well school, teacher and student
policies are being implemented in the school system. GEPD also measures
de-jure policy indicators which measure the strength and quality of the
underlying student, teacher and school management policies. Analysis of
the difference in these indicators shows gaps in implementation of
education policies in schools.

A \textasciitilde{}\textbf{0.7 point average gap} exists between the
de-facto policy levers and de-jure policies in Rwanda across teaching
and school management, suggesting there are some gaps in policy
implementation in teaching and school management. Smallest gaps
suggesting good level of implementation are observed for Teaching -
Monitoring \& Accountability(-1.9 points), Management-Clarity of
functions(0.1 points) and Teaching- Evaluation(0.5 points).

Largest gaps indicating a mismatch in policy design and policy

Selection \& Deployment(1.1 points). The breakdown of sub-indicators
within these de-facto policy levers show the specific areas where scores
are the lowest, contributing to the gap observed in policy
