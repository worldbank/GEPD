# Purpose:  Run file for high frequency and data quality checks for the school survey
# Author: Brian Stacy
# This file will run four R scripts in order.
# Each file can be run independently, but you will be prompted for certain paths that may not be specified
# This file will sequency the R scripts the correct way to produce an
# R markdown html file with high frequency and data quality checks for the school survey.
# 1. school_api.R                       #This file will access the Survey Solutions API and pull rawdata and paradata  
# 2. school_data_cleaner.R              #This file opens the raw data and cleans it to produce our indicators for the Dashboard
# 3. school_paradata.R                  #This file opens paradata produced by Survey Solutions to calculate length 
#                                        of time per module and other checks
# 4. school_data_quality_checks.Rmd     #This file produces an R Markdown report containing several quality checks.
